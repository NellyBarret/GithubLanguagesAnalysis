# GitHub programming languages analysis
This project aims to show the popularity of programming languages that are used on [GitHub](https://github.com/) through years.

Our main challenge was to illustrate programming languages evolution through the years. In order to do that, we have retrieve a lot of data (i.e. repositories and their metadata) on [GitHub API](https://developer.github.com/v3/). After that, we have processed all these repos into a JSON file. We have produced a chord diagram with some parameters to visualize it nicely and a bar chart to compare the poplarity of languages between years.

## Our inspiration

* [This paper](https://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~filkov/papers/lang_github.pdf) established a comparison between 17 programming languages in order to order them by a score. This score is based on the number of projects that used the language, the number of authors, the number of commits and some others indicators.
* And our minds to think about a great project for our data visualization course !
